Independent variables are those that are not influenced by each other, while covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together.<\/p><br\/><p>For example, if we have two variables, X and Y, and X is independent of Y, then it means that the value of X does not depend on the value of Y, and vice versa. In other words, knowing the value of one variable does not help predict the value of the other. However, if X and Y are not independent, then they may be correlated or have a covariance.<\/p><br\/><p>In your question, you have mentioned that the covariance between your final exam score and Riot Games&apos; revenue is 0, but you have not specified whether the two variables are independent. If they are independent, then this means that knowing one does not help predict the other, and the covariance will be 0. However, if they are not independent, then the covariance may still be 0 even if there is a correlation between them.<\/p><br\/><p>It is possible to have a non-zero covariance between two variables even if they are independent. For example, imagine that we have two random variables, X and Y, which represent the length of time it takes to read two books. If X and Y are independent, it would mean that reading one book does not affect the amount of time it takes to read the other book, and vice versa. However, if the mean length of time it takes to read both books is 2 hours, and the variance of the first book is 0.5 hours, while the variance of the second book is 0.25 hours, then the covariance between the two variables would be 0.5*0.25 = 0.125 hours. This non-zero covariance would indicate that there is a correlation between the two variables, even though they are independent.<\/p><br\/><p>In summary, a covariance of 0 indicates that two variables are independent, but a non-zero covariance does not necessarily mean that the variables are dependent or correlated.<\/p>","DataExportTag":"task3M2","QuestionID":"QID41"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_d0bjW0O4hsajzJI","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID11","SecondaryAttribute":"<p>As of my last knowledge update in January 1990, I do not know about an incident where Russia inva","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p>As of my last knowledge update in January 1990, I do not know about an incident where Russia invaded Ukraine .
